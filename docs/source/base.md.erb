## Reset
`base/reset` provides a simple CSS reset that removes margins and padding, sets
`box-sizing`, and adds some basic margins to common content elements such as `p`
and `ul`.

## Base
`base/base` sets styles for the `html` element, including font styles for the
page.

## Typography
`base/typography` sets default styles for typographic elements and adds classes
for those styles. For example, if you want a piece of text to *look* like a `h1`
wihout changing its semantic value, you can add a class of `f-alpha` to the
element.

<%= code_example('<h1>This is a level 1 heading</h1>

<h2>A level 2 heading</h2>

<h3>A level 3 heading</h3>

<h4>A level 4 heading</h4>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<p>This is a paragraph <a href="#">with a link</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<span class="f-alpha">This is a span with the appearance of h1</span>

<span class="f-beta">This is a span with the appearance of h2</span>')%>
