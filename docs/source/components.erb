<h2>Banners</h2>
<p>Banners are used to display important information to the user. Typically,
  they are pinned to the top of the page, but may also be detached or appear
  anywhere in the page.</p>

<p>Banners come in four flavors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>neutral</li>
  <li>success</li>
  <li>warning</li>
  <li>error</li>
</ul>

<%= code_example('<div class="c-banner">
  This is a neutral banner.
</div>

<div class="c-banner c-banner--success">
  This is a success banner! You did it!
</div>

<div class="c-banner c-banner--warning">
  This is a warning banner. Something&rsquo;s up.
</div>

<div class="c-banner c-banner--error u-l-p">
  This is an error banner. Go back to square one.
</div>

<div class="c-banner c-banner--unpinned">
  This is a floating or "unpinned" banner.
</div>') %>
